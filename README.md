Set up Suricata to act as NIDS and create some rules and review the output log


## About 
Suricata is a Network Intrusion Detection System (actually, its a multi functional cybersecurity tool, but Im focusing on this part for now).

Suricata monitors network traffic coming in and out of the network. It uses a set of detection rules to look for malicious patterns within the traffic and detect any potential attempts to compromise the network.

 In case of any detection, it will create an alert and send that alert to the user.
